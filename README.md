# This is second version of my own personal website.
  The tech stack for this is jQuery, CSS, and HTML.
  For the parallax effect I used the skrollr.js library

  Goals for this website:
  As of 02/13/2020 I am hoping to move the stack to React with Sass.
  For the projects portion I am planning on making a carousel that will let you turn to more of my projects.
